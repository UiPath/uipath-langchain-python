Could you please provide an update on the current status?\n\nOrder number: #FC6355D6\nPickup date: December 11, 2025\nDestination: Hamburg, Germany\n\nAccording to the tracking page, the last update was on December 13th showing \"In Transit - Paris Hub\". It's been 3 days with no updates and we need to know:\n\n- Where is the shipment currently located?\n- What is the estimated delivery date to Hamburg?\n- Are there any customs clearance issues we should be aware of?\n- Will it still arrive by December 20th as originally scheduled?\n\nOur client is asking for updates and I'd like to give them accurate information. If there are any delays, please let me know so we can manage their expectations.\n\nAlso, a quick question - for future shipments to Germany, what's the typical transit time from Manchester? We're planning our Q1 logistics schedule.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nBest,\nJames Wilson\nLogistics Coordinator\nSummit Manufacturing Ltd.\nEmail: j.wilson@summitmanufacturing.co.uk\nPhone: +44 161 555 0123",
