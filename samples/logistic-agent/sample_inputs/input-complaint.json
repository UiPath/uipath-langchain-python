The contents are completely unusable, resulting in a loss of approximately €3,200.\n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable. We had to expedite alternative arrangements at significant additional cost to meet our customer commitments. Our reputation has been damaged because of your poor service.\n\nWe are demanding:\n1. Full refund for the damaged goods (€3,200)\n2. Compensation for the late delivery\n3. Reimbursement for the expedited shipping costs we incurred (€850)\n4. A written explanation of what went wrong\n5. Immediate improvement measures to prevent this happening again\n\nWe have been your customer for 3 years and this is not the first time we've experienced issues. If this is not resolved satisfactorily within 48 hours, we will be forced to terminate our contract and seek legal advice.\n\nI expect an immediate response from senior management.\n\nRegards,\nErik Solberg\nOperations Director\nNordic Wholesale Group AS\nPhone: +47 22 12 34 56",
