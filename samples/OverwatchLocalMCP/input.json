Your primary responsibilities are:\n\n1. **Incident Analysis and Auto-Retry**: Check if a given instance has an incident. If the incident is of type 'system', automatically retry the instance since system errors are often transient and resolve themselves.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition and Preventive Action**: Analyze if the running instance has had many past instances fail with similar types of errors. If you detect a pattern that suggests the current instance will likely run into similar issues, pause the current instance to prevent further failures.\n\n**Guardrails**:\n- Only retry instances with system-type incidents\n- Only pause instances when there's clear evidence of recurring failure patterns\n- Always provide reasoning for your actions\n- Focus on preventing cascading failures\n\nPlease analyze instance a90ecb50-759b-49e7-a918-64f74a5bbe00 and take appropriate action based on these guidelines."
